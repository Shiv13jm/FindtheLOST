# FindtheLOST

**GitHub ReadMe for Face Recognition Attendance System**

This Python code implements a real-time face recognition attendance system using OpenCV and face_recognition library. The program captures video from the webcam and compares detected faces against a pre-defined set of known faces. If a recognized face is found, the system marks the attendance and logs the time and name into a CSV file named with the current date. The CSV file can be used for tracking the lost person.

**Features:**
- Real-time face recognition using webcam
- Attendance tracking with timestamps
- User-friendly display of recognized faces
- Automatic CSV file generation for attendance records

To use the program, ensure you have Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, and other necessary libraries installed. Run the script, and the attendance system will start working.

*Note: Ensure you have permission to use and store images and data for face recognition*
